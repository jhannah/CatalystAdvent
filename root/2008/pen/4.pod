=head1 Catalyst and OpenBSD

On OpenBSD we have a package management that allows us to
get a fully-fledged Catalyst environment quite easily and fast ready.

There are two possible ways to achieve this but this article sticks to the
officially recommended one: packages.
The other route would be the ports collection but that's a different
story.

=head1 Preparation

Given you have installed OpenBSD 4.4, the first thing before you can start is to
pick a mirror nearby you from L<http://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html>.
I use my favorite mirror in this article, which is located in
Europe/Germany, quite fast and up to date: L<ftp://ftp.de.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/>.

Now you need to append the path to the package directory.
In my case - using amd64 - that is B<4.4/packages/amd64>.
For i386, macppc and so on just replace the architecture with the one
you're using.

With the mirror and the package directory we have the complete URL pointing to
L<ftp://ftp.de.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.4/packages/amd64>
which we put it into the environment variable called B<PKG_PATH>.

What you enter on your terminal (assuming a korn-like shell) is:

  $ export PKG_PATH=ftp://ftp.de.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.4/packages/amd64
  $

To save you from repeating that in the future, just put it into the shell
profile (B<~/.profile> for ksh).

Further i assume you're in the group B<wheel> so you can run B<sudo>.

=head1 Installation

Now fetch the B<index.txt> file so you can use B<grep> to easily find packages:

  $ ftp $PKG_PATH/index.txt
  Trying 2001:638:a00:f008::1...
  ftp: connect to address 2001:638:a00:f008::1: No route to host
  Trying 131.188.40.91...
  Connected to openbsd.informatik.uni-erlangen.de.
  ...

  112067 bytes received in 0.61 seconds (178.44 KB/s)
  $

Given we want to know all packages have B<Catalyst> in their name we run
B<grep> like this:

  $ grep Catalyst index.txt
  p5-Catalyst-Action-RenderView-0.08.tgz
  p5-Catalyst-Authentication-Store-DBIx-Class-0.104.tgz
  p5-Catalyst-Controller-FormBuilder-0.04.tgz
  p5-Catalyst-Controller-Rose-0.02.tgz
  p5-Catalyst-Devel-1.08.tgz
  p5-Catalyst-Engine-Apache-1.12.tgz
  ...
  p5-Catalyst-View-TT-0.27.tgz
  p5-Catalyst-View-TT-ForceUTF8-0.06.tgz
  p5-Catalyst-View-TT-FunctionGenerator-0.01.tgz
  p5-Catalyst-View-XSLT-0.04.tgz
  p5-Test-WWW-Mechanize-Catalyst-0.42.tgz
  $

We see L<p5-Catalyst-Devel|http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Devel> in
the list and continue to install it:

  $ sudo pkg_add p5-Catalyst-Devel
  p5-Class-Accessor-0.31: complete
  p5-Config-General-2.36: complete
  p5-File-Copy-Recursive-0.36: complete
  p5-Module-Install-0.67:p5-ExtUtils-CBuilder-0.18: complete
  ...
  p5-Catalyst-Plugin-ConfigLoader-0.20: complete
  p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Static-Simple-0.20:p5-MIME-Types-1.24: complete
  p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Static-Simple-0.20: complete
  p5-Catalyst-Devel-1.08: complete
  $

... done, wasn't that easy?!  We have all we need for the Catalyst base system.

For session support we install 
the L<session plugin|http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Plugin::Session>,
the L<file store|http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::File>
and L<cookie state|http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::Cookie> modules:

  $ sudo pkg_add p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Session-Store-File p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Session-State-Cookie
  p5-Error-0.17009: complete
  p5-IPC-ShareLite-0.09p0: complete
  p5-Digest-SHA1-2.11p0: complete
  p5-Cache-Cache-1.05: complete
  p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Session-0.19:p5-Object-Signature-1.05p1: complete
  p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Session-0.19: complete
  p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Session-Store-File-0.13: complete
  p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Session-State-Cookie-0.09: complete
  $
  
Lets say we want the application to use the
L<authentication plugin|http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication> too:

  $ sudo pkg_add p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Authentication
  p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Authentication-0.10006: complete
  $

... and L<DBIx::Class|http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class> as the
L<authentication store|http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Store::DBIC>:

  $ sudo pkg_add p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Authentication-Store-DBIC
  p5-JSON-2.10: complete
  p5-DBI-1.604:p5-Net-Daemon-0.43: complete
  p5-DBI-1.604:p5-PlRPC-0.2018p0: complete
  p5-DBI-1.604: complete
  ...
  p5-Set-Object-1.22: complete
  p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Authorization-Roles-0.05p1:p5-Universal-isa-0.06p1: complete
  p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Authorization-Roles-0.05p1: complete
  p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Authentication-Store-DBIC-0.07p1: complete
  $

Now everything is installed and we can start to develop...

=head1 Development and Testing

To create a new Catalyst application, using the infamous name B<MyApp>, we type:

  $ catalyst.pl MyApp
  created "MyApp"
  created "MyApp/script"
  created "MyApp/lib"
  created "MyApp/root"
  ...
  created "MyApp/script/myapp_fastcgi.pl"
  created "MyApp/script/myapp_server.pl"
  created "MyApp/script/myapp_test.pl"
  created "MyApp/script/myapp_create.pl"
  $

Then change to the directory ...

  $ cd MyApp
  $

... and start the local server:

  $ ./script/myapp_server.pl
  [debug] Debug messages enabled
  [debug] Statistics enabled
  [debug] Loaded plugins:
  ...
  
  [info] MyApp powered by Catalyst 5.7014
  You can connect to your server at http://127.0.0.1:3000

Now you can connect to L<http://127.0.0.1:3000> and see the Catalyst
welcome page.

This is the point you can start implementing whatever nice application you want.

=head1 Deployment

After some time you surely want to make your application is accessible to others.

As OpenBSD comes already with an httpd capable to handle all this you only
need to configure it appropriately.
Using FastCGI is a quite performat option, so we install mod_fastcgi, the FCGI
module and FCGI::ProcManager:

  $ sudo pkg_add mod_fastcgi fcgi p5-FCGI-ProcManager
  mod_fastcgi-2.4.2p2: complete
  fcgi-2.4.0p3: complete
  p5-FCGI-ProcManager-0.18: complete
  --- mod_fastcgi-2.4.2p2 -------------------
  To finish the install of mod_fastcgi, you need
  to enable the module using the following command
  
    /usr/local/sbin/mod_fastcgi-enable
  
  If you already have Apache running on your machine,
  you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
  you should fully stop and then restart the server.
  $

To enable enable mod_fastcgi we just need to type:

  $ sudo /usr/local/sbin/mod_fastcgi-enable
  Enabling  module...
  [activating module `fastcgi' in /var/www/conf/httpd.conf]
  cp /usr/local/lib/mod_fastcgi.so /usr/lib/apache/modules/mod_fastcgi.so
  chmod 755 /usr/lib/apache/modules/mod_fastcgi.so
  cp /var/www/conf/httpd.conf /var/www/conf/httpd.conf.bak
  cp /var/www/conf/httpd.conf.new /var/www/conf/httpd.conf
  rm /var/www/conf/httpd.conf.new
  $

Then, in C</var/www/conf/httpd.conf> we configure FastCGI like this:

  FastCgiExternalServer /myapp -socket /tmp/myapp.socket

  Alias / /myapp/

Stop and start the server to load mod_fastcgi:

  $ sudo apachectl stop
  /usr/sbin/apachectl stop: httpd stopped
  $ sudo apachectl start
  /usr/sbin/apachectl start: httpd started
  $

The last thing we need to do is to start B<script/myapp_fastcgi.pl>.

One thing is important here: the httpd on OpenBSD is running in a change root
environment per default, which is rooted at B</var/www>.

So the path to the socket specified in the httpd.conf is relative to this, which
means the actual path to the socket is B</var/www/tmp/myapp.socket>.

First we create a tmp directory below B</var/www>:

  $ sudo mkdir -m 1777 /var/www/tmp

And now we start the fastcgi process:

  $ ./script/myapp_fastcgi.pl -l /var/www/tmp/myapp.socket
  ...
  FastCGI: manager (pid 277): initialized
  FastCGI: manager (pid 277): server (pid 31335) started
  FastCGI: server (pid 31335): initialized

Connect to your server address and see the application running there.

One thing that is recommended, is to serve static files with the webserver rather
than the application.
Given you've put the application into the change root environment to
B</var/www/MyApp> you need to add the following to the B<httpd.conf> B<behind>
the Alias directive mapping the FastCGI application:

  Alias /static/ /MyApp/root/static/

Congratulations, your deployment should be generally ready for prime time.
