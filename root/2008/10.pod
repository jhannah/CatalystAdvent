=head1 Day 10.  Dealing with Config::General's inability to provide single item arrays.

Today's recipe is very quick and simple, but scratches a minor irritation. L<Config::General> (Apache-style) is the default configuration file format, which is great for readability, and the ease with which non-programmers can modify it.  However, it doesn't deal with single item arrays well. That is if you have the following configuration:

 <some_values>
 want_an_array some data
 </some_values>

But this wil some out as a scalar:

 print $c->{config}->{some_values}

results in the output C< some data >.

One way of fixing this is to just provide spurious extra keys in the config file:

 <some_values>
 want_an_array some data
 want_an_array junk
 </some_values>

And now you have an array:

 print $c->{config}->{some_values}
 ARRAY(0x800d80)

=head2 When it absolutely has to be an array and needs to be able to have a length of 1.

Unfortunately this is not entireley satisfactory as sometimes you need to know the length of the array without cumbersome workarounds.  Enter L<Moose>:


 setup => sub {
     use Moose::Autobox;
     $_[0]->config->{some_values}{want_an_array} = [ $_[0]->config->{some_values}{want_an_array}->flatten ];
 }

Place this solution in MyApp.pm and the problem is fixed!
