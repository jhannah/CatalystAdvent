=head1 Catalyst::ScriptRunner

Summer of 2009 brought some great things, and one of these things was my
being accepted into the Google Summer of Code!  My project was to
refactor the L<Catalyst::Helper> API and L<Catalyst::Devel> package
into something a little less hateful. And I accomplished this, more or less. 

=head2 Application skeleton files are now in a sharedir

The application skeleton files are now stored in a sharedir, making it
much easier to alter / patch the content of generated
applications. Component authors can also now use a sharedir, and can use
the the extra C<render_sharedir_file> method to get templates from a
sharedir generated by their Helper class.

=head2 Scripts are now Classes

The scripts, instead of being entities on their own, now just delegate the
work to a C<< ScriptRunner >> class which finds a script class, loads it,
makes an instance, and invokes its C<< ->run >> method.

If you open up a new script, you'll see something like
this:

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    use Catalyst::ScriptRunner;
    Catalyst::ScriptRunner->run('MyApp', 'Server');

    1;
	
As opposed to 100+ lines of development server logic.

=head2 What does this do for me?

This means that fixing bugs in the scripts is significantly easier and
less hassle for B<you>, because new scripts are included in
L<Catalyst::Runtime>. Therefore you get the benefit of them just by
upgrading, rather than having to regenerate your scripts.

Also, you can write custom scripts, or easily add options to the
existing scripts.  This is Really Good if you want to hack your own
server with additional command line flags. If you create a class called
C<< MyApp::Script::XXX >>, then L<Catalyst::ScriptRunner> will pick it
up and run it in favor of the built-in script.

Authors of alternate engines should also be able to reuse
L<Catalyst::ScriptRole>, provide a C<Catalyst::Script::> class and a
C<Catalyst::Helper::> class, and then generate C<myapp_engine.pl> scripts
for the user which work just like the other scripts, without duplicating
all of the script code.

L<Gitalist> is an example of an application already taking advantage of
per-application scripts to provide a C<< --repo_dir >> option.

=head2 Application skeleton now uses Moose

The generated application skeleton has been tidied up in a number of ways, and
now generates applications which use L<Moose> and L<namespace::autoclean>,
tests which use C< done_testing >, and which turn off some deprecated features.

That's all folks, short and simple. 

Hopefully you'll think of some cool and fun uses for the new scripts and
Helper code, and you'll blog in your Ironman blogs about them, or come
chat to us in C< #catalyst-dev > about what you'd like to do if it
doesn't seem obvious.

This new work is a good basis for people being able to do cool things, but
I'm sure there is some work still to be done to make it easier when
people start experimenting with their real life use-cases.
