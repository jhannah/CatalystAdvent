=head1 CiderWebmail

Webmail sucks. We are Perl programmers. We like our mutt or maybe our
kmail but at times, webmail is the only thing available. And the only
webmailers available are written in PHP and they all have their
difficulties and problems. In the Perl republic we have great
components: we have Catalyst, we have Mail::IMAPClient, we have
MIME::Tools and many more. The only thing missing was an application
that pulled these together into a usable application: CiderWebmail

=head2 What we want

If you live email, your mailbox probably contains thousands or tens of
thousands of messages. Since we're used to the features of modern
email clients, these thousands are probably contained in only a few
folders.

Our goal is to handle these mailboxes efficiently like a local
client. We want our webmailer to be snappy with folders containing
10_000 messages so you can quickly find the message that you need. We
really care about the user experience. That means, not needing to
guess which one of the 388 pages of messages is the important one,
near instant response time, configurable and themeable keybindings,
and an intuitive (possibly beautiful) user interface.

=head2 How is it done?

CiderWebmail is a Catalyst application using L<Mail::IMAPClient> as
backend, L<MIME::Tools> to parse messages, L<Petal> as template engine
and JavaScript and AJAX in the front end to make drag &amp; drop and
on demand message loading work.

We try to write really modern Perl. By following best practices, we
produce code that's fun to work with. Some of these practices are thin
controllers, logic-free templates, test suites and tidy, documented
code.

=head2 What you can do

The current version 1.01 is usable. It works for us and already has
some nice features. But it can be improved on all fronts: It needs:

=item *

testing (and tests)

=item *

more documentation

=item *

packaging

=item *

better JavaScript (porting to JQuery?)

=item *

HTML message creation (yes, some people really want this)

=item *

more configurability

=item *

cool features!

=item *

better design

=item *

a logo :)

=back

... and much more. Any help is greatly appreciated. We know that the
code is only a part of the whole - a very interesting part to us
programmers, but itself nearly worthless without the rest or the
project.

=head2 How to start

You can get the code and information at L<http://ciderwebmail.org>.
There's a project mailing list, available at
L<http://lists.scsys.co.uk/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/cider-webmail> If
you have any questions, problems, ideas, patches, bug reports or
anything else related to CiderWebmail, you can post there and usually
receive a quick response.
