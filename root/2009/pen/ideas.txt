Articles structure
  - most writers don't have tuits for big editorials and guides, so concise articles with snippets of code are recommended
  - introduction: why/when use the technique/module/advice presented here
  - body: snippets of copy-pasted code, with just enough comments to make it clear (similar to modules SYNOPSYS)
  - ending: further reading, stuff we didn't include but you should know about, alternatives, caveats

  - should mention free support in exchange of docpatches, liberal commit/comaint rights
