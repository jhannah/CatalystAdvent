Articles structure
  - most writers don't have tuits for big editorials and guides, so concise articles with snippets of code are recommended
  - introduction: why/when use the technique/module/advice presented here
  - body: snippets of copy-pasted code, with just enough comments to make it clear (similar to modules SYNOPSYS)
  - ending: further reading, stuff we didn't include but you should know about, alternatives, caveats

Confirmed ideas:
  - DBIx::Class::Schema::Versioned - castaway
  - Plack + Catalyst - miyagawa (or an editor with miyagawa's help)

Starting article
  - a call to action similar in tone to 'How perl happens' (chromatic) and 'Dreamcasting' (mst)
  - should mention free support in exchange of docpatches, liberal commit/comaint rights

  - mst
