=head1 Day 11 - $c->uri_for fun and profit

Today we will take a trip into the wonderful and mystical world of uri_for.
The basic premise behind uri_for is to make generating URIs for actions with parameters easy and fun (well as fun as URIs get).

=head2 Basic uri_for
$c->uri_for will return the URL for the current actions namespace, so, if you are in Controller MyApp::Children it will return 

    http://localhost:3000/children

for any action you are running in that controller. 
If you wanted to get to a specific action you can do

    $c->uri_for('good') which would give you http://localhost:3000/child/good

What if I wanted to get outside of the 'child' namespace? well, use a / to root it :

    $c->uri_for('/elves')
    http://localhost:3000/elves
 
For most cases this simple construct is more than adequate but a more canonical way is via the action_for construct for instance, If in my controller i have

    sub deliverto :Path('good') {
        ...
    }

I could refer to this action in the current namespace as follows

    $c->uri_for($c.action_for('deliverto')) 
    http://localhost:3000/children/good

If, in the future i decided to change my URI structure all the references to this controller would update accordingly.

This technique also has other uses we will come to later.

=head2 Adding parameters

You can easily add parameters to the uri_for object like this:

    $c->uri_for('house',{fire => 0, mincepie => 1});
    http://localhost:3000/house?chimney=0&amp;mincepie=1

or even in a TT template:

    [% c.uri_for('house',{fire => 0, mincepie => 1}) %]
    http://localhost:3000/house?chimney=0&amp;mincepie=1

or you could use the params that were passed into the page to re-populate it

    [% c.uri_for('bar',c.req.params) %]
    http://localhost:3000/bar?a=b&amp;c=d (assuming parameters passed in to page were a=b c=d)

=head2 Complex paths with captures

uri_for makes it incredibly easy to create and adjust paths for chained actions, for instance

    $c.uri_for($c.action,$c.req.captures,'print');

would fill out all the captures in the current uri and add new to it
http://localhost:3000/house/4/address/print

But what if you wanted to change some of the captures... say for linking from a list - well it's just an array so thats easy :

    $c.uri_for($c.action,[2],'new');
    http://localhost:3000/house/2/address/print

=head2 uri_for internals

uri_for returns a normalised URI object so you can do all the usual tricks, for instance, say you were wanting to go to a secure section of your catalyst site you could do the following : 

    my $uri = c.uri_for('secure');
    $uri->scheme('https');
    https://localhost:3000/letters/list

=head2 useful code snippets

You could add these in your root controller to make them available for all your actions. 
(thanks zamolxes!)

    sub action_uri {
            my ($c, $controller, $action, @params) = @_;
            return $c->uri_for($c->controller($controller)->action_for($action), @params);
    }

    sub redirect_to_action {
            my ($c, $controller, $action, @params) =@_;
            $c->response->redirect($c->uri_for($c->controller($controller)->action_for($action), @params));
            $c->detach;
    }

    <a href="[% c.action_uri('Foo::Bar','baz',5) %]">BAZ!</a>

    $c->redirect_to_action('User','login');
