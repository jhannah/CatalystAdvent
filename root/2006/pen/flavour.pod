=head1 Day XX - Catalyst::Plugin::Flavour

Adding Sweet Flavours to Catalyst Controllers

=head1 Introduction

Have you ever thought about what smart way for handling multiple
template (or view) in one controller?

Plugin::Flavour provides it to you, as "flavour".

If you use Flavour plugin, then a request for

    http://example.com/path/to/action.flavour

This request is handled by /path/to/action and "flavour" is stored in
$c->flavour.

You can use multiple views in one controller like below code:

    $c->forward( $c->view( $c->flavour ) );

MAGIC!


=head1 Simple tutorial

Load plugin:

    use Catalyst qw/Flavour/;

Next up is configuration. If you use ConfigLoader, you edit
myapp.yml:

    flavour:
      default_flavour: html

C< default_flavour > is used when request url has no flavour part.
The default value is 'html', so you don't have to write it when you
use 'html' as default_flavour.

Before we forget, create View::TT.  Please run
C< ./script/myapp_create.pl view TT TT > before continuing.


The next step is to write controllers.  In this case, I use an html and
a json flavour.

Controller code:

    # MyApp::Controller::Root
    sub index : Private {
        my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
        $c->stash->{template} = 'index.' . $c->flavour;
    }

    sub end : ActionClass('RenderView') {}



Then write two templates.

index.html:

    <html>
    <head>
    <title>This is HTML</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>This is HTML!</h1>
    </body>
    </html>

index.json:

    {title:"This is JSON!"}

Well done!

This program is

L<http://localhost:3000/index.html> shows index.html,

L<http://localhost:3000/index.json> shows index.json,

and http://localhost:3000/ shows index.html (the default flavour)


=head1 Path to controller mapping

Here is list of path to controller mapping used by Plugin::Flavour.

=over 4

=item / | /index | /index.html

/index

=item /action | /action.html

/action

=item /path/to/ | /path/to/index | /path/to/index.html

/path/to/index

=item /path/to | /path/to.html

/path/to

=back

The last slash is important!  Suggestions and patchs are welcome for
this mapping!


=head1 Accessors for real path

Plugin::Flavour replace C< $c->request->uri > and C< $c->request->path
> for tricking the Catalyst dispatcher.  It provides additional
accessor C< $c->request->real_uri > and C< $c->request->real_path >
for the actual uri and path.
