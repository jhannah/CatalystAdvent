Ideas:
 - Catalyst::Plugin::MessageStack + Data::Manager model
   show how to have seamless integration with your validation model's messages
   simple message display plugin

 - Catalyst::View::TT::Bootstrap
   skinnable UI
 
 - CatalystX::BREAD
   simple BREAD layer with JSON api (much like a simple C::C::DBIC::API class)

 - sensible scaling and architectural choices (HI t0m :-))
 - start bugging people via email about writing articles
 - Bread::Board stuff
 - Facebook graph API stuff
 - twitter API stuff (I think I still have some code for this somewhere - dhoss)
 - new PSGI features (what they afford us in 5.9, etc)

 - AutoCRUD (thanks oliver)
 - mo: the interesting thing about metacpan-web is how we do concurrent requests to the api to build the page
 - dotcloud deployment (miyagawa?)
   other such cloud deployment
 - puppet psgi deployment
 - chef deployment
 - carton + catalyst
 - starman/server_starter sane web app process service management

 - multiple chains ending in one action
     t0m : the canonical example case being
            /cd/barcode/<ID>/track/<id> and
            /cd/by_number_from_the_left_on_my_self/<INDEX>/track/<id>
     t0m :  everything from /track can all be implemented by shared code, that
            just chains to ../find_cd (or whatever)
     rafl:  oh, right. and you get to compose actions chained like that into
            multiple controllers, getting "
     rafl: "multiple chains ending in one action", which is often requested
            but its support not very obvious

 - Internationalization and https://metacpan.org/module/MENDEL/Catalyst-Plugin-I18N-PathPrefix-0.07/lib/Catalyst/Plugin/I18N/PathPrefix.pm
   for localizing the path for example: /en/hello /de/hallo

Done:
 - "State of the Cat" -> t0m
 - "Checking for leaks in MyApp" - SpiceMan
 - "Fat Models" - lecster
 - "Keep your libraries organized" - dpetrov

Enqueued:
 

In Progress:
 - CatalystX::BREAD - dhoss
