Ideas:
 - Catalyst::Plugin::MessageStack + Data::Manager model
   show how to have seamless integration with your validation model's messages
   simple message display plugin

 - Catalyst::View::TT::Bootstrap
   skinnable UI
 
 - CatalystX::BREAD
   simple BREAD layer with JSON api (much like a simple C::C::DBIC::API class)

 - sensible scaling and architectural choices (HI t0m :-))
 - start bugging people via email about writing articles
 - Bread::Board stuff
 - Facebook graph API stuff
 - twitter API stuff (I think I still have some code for this somewhere - dhoss)
