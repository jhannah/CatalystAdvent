=head1 Turbocharge your SQLite App with WAL

In current SQLite versions, there is a feature called Write Ahead Logging or
L<WAL|http://www.sqlite.org/draft/wal.html>.

In a multi-process application such as a L<Catalyst> FastCGI instance, this
feature greatly improves average write performance, at the cost of occasional
writes taking slightly longer. See previously linked document for details.

To turn it on, add C<on_connect_do "PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;"> to your
L<Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema> configuration, a typical configuration might
be:

    <Model::DB>
        schema_class MyApp::Schema
        traits Caching
        <connect_info>
            dsn dbi:SQLite:dbname=__path_to(db/myapp.db)__
            quote_names 1
            auto_savepoint 1
            on_connect_do "PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;"
        </connect_info>
    </Model::DB>
